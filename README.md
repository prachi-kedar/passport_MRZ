The MRZ region in passports or travel cards fall into two classes: Type 1 and Type 3. Type 1 MRZs are three lines, with each line containing 30 characters. The Type 3 MRZ only has two lines, but each line contains 44 characters. In either case, the MRZ encodes identifying information of a given citizen, including the type of passport, passport ID, issuing country, name, nationality, expiration date, etc.
